# Disease Outbreaks Analysis in Nigeria

## Introduction

This Python project analyzes disease outbreak data in Nigeria. It utilizes various visualization techniques to understand disease prevalence, demographics of affected individuals, temporal patterns, health outcomes, and more. The project aims to provide insights into disease spread and its impact on different population groups.

## Data Source

The project uses a dataset named `disease_outbreaks_nigeria.csv`, which contains information about disease cases in Nigeria. The dataset includes details such as disease type, location, gender, age, health status, and confirmation status.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - numpy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Visualizations

### 1. Disease Prevalence by State (Bar Chart)
Visualizes the number of disease cases in each state of Nigeria.

### 2. Gender Disparity in Disease Cases (Pie Chart)
Illustrates the distribution of disease cases between male and female patients.

### 3. Age Distribution of Patients (Histogram)
Shows the distribution of patients across different age groups.

### 4. Trend Analysis Over Time (Area Chart)
Depicts the trend in confirmed disease cases over the years.

### 5. Child vs. Adult Affected Groups (Stacked Bar Chart)
Compares the number of disease cases between children and adults.

### 6. Distribution of Cases by Age and Disease (Bubble Chart)
Displays the distribution of cases across age groups, with bubble size representing age and color-coded by disease.

### 7. Health Status of Patients (Donut Chart)
Shows the distribution of health statuses (alive or dead) among patients.

### 8. Confirmation Status of Cases (Box Plot)
Illustrates the confirmation status of disease cases.

### 9. Time Series of Cases (Line Chart)
Shows the number of cases for a specific disease over time.

### 10. Disease Mortality Rates (Violin Plot)
Visualizes the distribution of mortality rates for different diseases.

### 11. Temporal Patterns (Line Chart)
Illustrates the temporal patterns in confirmed disease cases over the years.

### 12. Health Outcome by Settlement Type (Pairplot)
Compares the health outcomes between different settlement types.

### 13. Age Distribution of Patients (Box Plot)
Displays the distribution of patients' ages.

### 14. Correlation Analysis (Scatter Plot Matrix)
Shows the relationships between age, confirmed cases, and mortality.

### 15. Disease Prevalence (Venn Diagram)
Visualizes the overlap and prevalence of multiple diseases among the patients.

### 16. Specific Disease Distribution (Radial Wheel Plot)
Shows the distribution of cases for specific diseases.

## Usage

To use the project, simply run the Python script `main.py`. Ensure that the dataset file `disease_outbreaks_nigeria.csv` is in the same directory.

```bash
python main.py
```
